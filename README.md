# README

This is my getting started Arduino project. 

## Get started

Connect your programmer to your PC. 
If you have linux you probably have anything you need installed regarding drivers for the FTDI. 

Ensure you can write to the FTDI device by doing: 

```
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0
```

Open your Arduino IDE and set it up this way: 

```
Board: "Arduino Pro or Pro Mini"
Processor: "ATmega328 (5V, 16MHz)"
Programmer: "AVRISP mkII"
```
